# ape-overlay
An external overlay that utilizes DirectX 11; made as a project to learn DirectX 11.


## TODO
  - Find a faster method to get shader bytecode	
  - Fix rotation for line thickness
  - Add text rendering
  - Find a safer, better way to draw overlay (window hijacking?) (later in future when bypassing anticheats)
  - Cleanup codebase
